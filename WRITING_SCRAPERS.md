# Writing scrapers

## Available weapons

* beautifulsoup4

* requests

* lxml

* cssselect


## Rules of engagement

### How to layout the code



### What are the entry points and how are they launched
### How does config get passed to the scrapers



### Using dc

If you use dc for talking to CKAN, you need a ~/.dc.ini that looks a bit like:

[ckan]
url = http://localhost
api_key = 0000-0000-0000-0000

If you don't have this file, it'll crash and complain that it can't find it.
